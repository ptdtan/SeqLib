At its core, SnowTools is a C++ interface\r\nto the C htslib project, which provides the code for core BAM/SAM operations. \r\n(https://github.com/samtools/htslib)\r\n\r\nSnowTools is built to be extendable. See (...) for examples of how to take advantage of C++\r\nclass extensions to build off of the SnowTools base functionality. \r\n\r\nSnowTools is available as a stand-alone executable, which wrap a number of tools. \r\nHowever, certain functionality provided in an optimal form by SamTools or \r\nBamTools are intentially left out of SnowTools. In cases where improvements or alternative\r\napproaches are useful, the functionally is partially duplicated (e.g. count).\r\n\r\nAs noted above, there are many overlaps between this project at the BamTools project from Derek Barnett \r\n(https://github.com/pezmaster31/bamtools). As such, SnowTools is provided as a \r\na supplemental library that may be more suited to your individual needs that BamTools, or vice-versa. To\r\naid developers in deciding which package is right for them, I have put together a small list of \r\nsimilarities and differences between these two packages\r\n\r\n \r\nSnowTools/BamTools similarity\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\n> 1. Provide read/write access to BAM files\r\n> 2. Classes containing individual reads and ways to interact with them (e.g. edit tags)\r\n> 3. Available as an API and a command-line version\r\n\r\nSnowTools/BamTools differences\r\n------------------------------\r\nSnowTools/BamTools differences\r\n> 1. Sort/index functionality is independently implemented in BamTools. In SnowTools, the Samtools \r\n sort and index functions are called directly.\r\n> 2. BamTools stores quality scores and sequences as strings. In SnowTools, the HTSlib native bam1_t format\r\n is used instead. This format has a lower memory footprint by using only 4 bits per base, rather than 8. \r\n Conversion to C++ style std::string is provided as a function and can be done on the fly.\r\n> 3. BamTools provides the BamMultiReader class for reading multiple BAM files at once, while \r\n SnowTools does not currently support this functionality.\r\n> 4. SnowTools contains a built in interface to BWA-MEM for in-memory indexing and querying.\r\n> 5. SnowTools supports reading and writing CRAM files\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n```bash\r\n git clone https://github.com/broadinstitute/isva.git\r\n cd isva/SnowTools/src\r\n ./configure\r\n make\r\n```\r\n \r\nI have successfully compiled with GCC-4.9 on Linux.\r\n\r\nSupport\r\n-------\r\nThis code is being developed and maintained by Jeremiah Wala (jwala@broadinstitute.org)\r\n\r\nAttributions\r\n------------\r\n*Jeremiah Wala - Harvard MD-PhD candidate, Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics\r\n*Steve Schumacher - Research Scientist, Dana Farber Cancer Institute\r\n*Cheng-Zhong Zhang - Research Scientist, Broad Institute\r\n*Marcin Imielinski - Asst Prof, Cornell University\r\n\r\n\r\n[license]: https://github.com/broadinstitute/variant-bam/blob/master/LICENSE\r\n\r\n[BamTools]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/pezmaster31/bamtools/Tutorial_Toolkit_BamTools-1.0.pdf\r\n\r\n[API]: http://pezmaster31.github.io/bamtools/annotated.html\r\n\r\n[htmldoc]: http://www.broadinstitute.org/~jwala/SnowToolsDocs/index.html\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
